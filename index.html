    <h2>LOW COST ROMANTIC VENICE</h2>
    <p>Our Bed and Breakfast is located in a typical Venetian area, on the second floor of a Venetian palace, with private entrance and canal view, close to San Marco Square.</p>
    <p>The neighbourhood is very beautiful and characteristic, the house is just a footstep away from the most important monuments, churches and shops, with restaurants, pizzerias and bars around the corner.</p>
    <p>Take a look at our <a href="rooms.html">comfortable and elegant rooms</a>. Each bedroom has a seating area and balcony overlooking the canal.</p>
